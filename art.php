  I have been working with Photoshop off and on since the early 90's. Back in the early days of HTML we did not have CSS to make websites "shiny", so we relied on many graphics to fill the gap. It was durring this time I became good at making banners,web graphics, and photo editing. Today CSS replaces many of the aspects that I used to make graphics for, but I sill do graphics for forum and blog purposes, as well as one of my hobbies, fantasy cartography, where you make maps as artwork of fictional places.  Below are samples of my work.</p>
